ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **@alexmaichen**

I have some decent experience with (from most to least):
**Python3 (about 500 hours)
C/C++ (about 450 hours)
GDScript (about 80 hours)**

I have also used:
**Lua
JavaScript
Racket
Ocaml**

Somehow, despite my mild dislike for the OO paradigm, nearly all of my most-used are OOP languages.

You can reach me through `alexmaichen@gmail.com`, assuming I decide to check my e-mails frequently enough. If that does not work, message me on discord `@alexca`

I am a novice **programmer and a gamer**. I speedrun "**Hades**" the videogame.
