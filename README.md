👋 Hi, I’m **@alexmaichen**

I mainly program in
**Python
C/C++
GDScript
Ocaml
Lua**

I have also used:
**JavaScript
Racket
Pike**

Somehow, despite my mild dislike for the OO paradigm, nearly all of my most-used are OOP languages.

You can reach me through `alexmaichen@gmail.com`, assuming I decide to check my e-mails frequently enough. If that does not work, message me on discord `@alexca`

I am a novice **programmer and a gamer**. I speedrun "**Hades**" the videogame.
